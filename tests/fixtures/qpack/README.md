# QPACK fixture corpus

Story-format JSON files for QPACK decoder/encoder conformance testing,
mirroring the HPACK corpus in `tests/fixtures/hpack/`.

## Format

Each story JSON has:

- `description`, `source` — provenance
- `table_capacity` — dynamic table capacity the encoder used (a decoder in
  tests advertises this as its max; its table starts at capacity 0 and the
  Set Dynamic Table Capacity instruction applies on the encoder stream)
- `max_blocked_streams` — encoder's blocked-stream allowance
- `delay_encoder_stream` (optional, `nghttp3/` sets it) — tests deliver
  every field section before any encoder stream bytes, so dynamic
  references block and are unblocked as the encoder records arrive
- `cases` — records in story order, one shared compression context:

  - `seqno` — sequence number within the story
  - `stream_id` — 0 for encoder stream bytes, anything else for the encoded
    field section of that stream (streams are opaque identifiers)
  - `wire` — the record as a hex string
  - `headers` (field sections only) — the expected decoded header list as
    an ordered array of `[name, value]` pairs, in wire order

Names and values are opaque bytes; non-UTF-8 content is stored 1:1 as code
points (latin-1 mapping, `\uXXXX`-escaped), so byte values are recovered
with `char as u8`.

## Directories

| Directory | Source | Coverage notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nghttp3/` | nghttp3 `qpack` example tool encoding ls-qpack `test/qifs/` | real-world Facebook request/response and NetBSD header lists at 256- and 4096-octet tables, plus a long-string exercise; encoder- and section-stream records interleave, exercising blocked streams |
| `spec/` | RFC 9204 Appendix B | hand-transcribed spec examples: literal static name ref, set capacity + inserts + post-Base refs, speculative insert + duplicate + relative refs |

## Usage in tests

- `tests/qpack_fixtures.rs` (committed): corpus parsing + checks.
- Decoder test: feed records in story order (encoder records to
  `Decoder::feed_encoder_stream`, field sections to `Decoder::decode_block`,
  parking blocked sections) and compare decoded lists to `headers`.
- Encoder test: for each field section, encode `headers` with a fresh
  `Encoder` at the story capacity and require a decode round-trip to match.

## Regeneration

`scripts/harvest_qpack_fixtures.sh` regenerates `nghttp3/`; spec stories are
hand-maintained from the RFC text.
