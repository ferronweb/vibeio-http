# HPACK fixture corpus

Story-format JSON files for HPACK decoder/encoder conformance testing.

## Format

Each `story_XX.json` contains a `cases` array; all cases in a story share one
compression context (dynamic table state carries across cases in order).
Each case has:

- `seqno` — sequence number within the story
- `wire` — the encoded header block as a hex string
- `headers` — the decoded header list as an ordered array of single-key
  objects (pseudo-headers and regular headers, in wire order)
- `header_table_size` (optional) — `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` value to
  apply before this case

License: MIT (see `LICENSE` in the source repository).

All files are verbatim copies from the source repository. The `wire` values
were produced by each encoder implementation listed below; `raw-data/` in
the source repo contains the unencoded stories.

## Directories

| Directory | Encoder that produced `wire` | Coverage notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nghttp2/` | nghttp2 `deflatehd` (default 4096-octet table) | full story set incl. large-value stories |
| `nghttp2-16384-4096/` | nghttp2 with 16384-octet table | dynamic-table growth across a session |
| `nghttp2-change-table-size/` | nghttp2 with explicit size changes | `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` mid-session updates |
| `go-hpack/` | Go `x/net/http2/hpack` encoder | Go implementation output (huffman-heavy) |
| `python-hpack/` | python-hyper/hpack encoder | third independent implementation |

## Trimming

Large-value stories (`story_21/22/27/29/30.json`) are retained only in
`nghttp2/` to bound repository size; `nghttp2-16384-4096/` and
`nghttp2-change-table-size/` do not contain `story_31.json` upstream.

## Usage in tests

- `tests/hpack_fixtures.rs` (committed): corpus parsing + sanity checks.
- Decoder tests: for each case in story order, decode `wire` and compare the
  header list to `headers` (shared context; apply `header_table_size` first).
- Encoder tests: encode the `headers` lists with a fresh encoder, decode the
  result, and require the decoded header set to match.
