//! Primitives shared between HPACK (RFC 7541) and QPACK (RFC 9204).
//!
//! Both header-compression schemes use the same Huffman code
//! (RFC 7541 Appendix B, reused verbatim by RFC 9204 Section 4.2) and the
//! same prefix-integer representation (RFC 7541 Section 5.1, reused by
//! RFC 9204 Section 4.3). These live here, one level up from the protocol
//! modules that consume them, so neither codec needs to depend on the other.
//!
//! Consumers: `h2::hpack` (HPACK) and `h3::qpack` (QPACK).
//!
//! This module is also the public `vibeio_http::hpack` path: the HPACK
//! codec surface (`Decoder`, `Encoder`, `Header`) is re-exported from
//! `h2::hpack` so the crate API is unchanged by the refactor.
